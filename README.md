## Project Proposal: Visualizing Global Carbon Emissions Using Our World In Data: CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**Project Title:**

Visualizing Global Carbon Emissions Using Our World In Data: CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**Goal of the Project:**
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns with carbon and gas emissions by country. We'll examine relationships between country, population, temperature over the course of a decade, and other related relationships derived from the data.
