## Project Proposal: Visualizing Global Carbon Emissions Using Our World In Data: CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**Project Title:**

Visualizing Global Carbon Emissions Using Our World In Data: CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**Goal of the Project:**
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns with carbon and gas emissions by country. We'll examine relationships between country, population, temperature over the course of a decade, and other related relationships derived from the data.

**Desired Outcome:**

The final outcome will be a web-based Global Emission dashboard that offers users the ability to:

  - Explore CO2 emissions per capita across different countries and time periods.
  - Visualize Co2 emission contribution by selected Countries
  - Global emission contribution by nitrous oxide -N2O,  Methane - CH4 and Carbon Dioxide- CO2 emissions
  - Dropdown list to view quick summary of analysis statistics: Top 5 countries by Co2 emission, Top 5 countries by Co2 per capita, Highest temp change by Co2 source, Highest temp change by GHG emission


**Data Sources**
