## Data Visualisation Track ##
### Visualizing Global Carbon Emissions Using Our World In Data: CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions ###

**Project Title:**

Visualizing Global Carbon Emissions Using Our World In Data: CO₂ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions

**Purpose of the Project:**

To produce a dashboard that is a clear, high level overview of global carbon emissions
This dashboard is specifically designed for key decision makers who have a major influence to carbon emissions where a reduction could be made. These decision makers include Government officials,Corporate leaders in major carbon usage companies and Researchers especially those working on environmental science.

**How to Use:**
The location of the dashboard is: https://lhenry97.github.io/Project_3_Group_4/

The first half of the dashboard provides summary of emissions data globally. 
The following data is present:
  - Visualize Co2 emission contribution by selected Countries
  - Compare total CO2 emission between two countries
  - Global emission contribution by nitrous oxide -N2O,  Methane - CH4 and Carbon Dioxide- CO2 emissions
  - Dropdown list to view quick summary of analysis statistics: Top 5 countries by Co2 emission, Top 5 countries by Co2 per capita, Highest temp change by Co2 source, Highest temp change by GHG emission

The second half of the dashboard provides data on individual countries with the user being able to select 1 of the 32 countries data provided.
The following data is present:
  - Dropdown list allowing the user to select the desired country.
  - Visialise CO2 emissions per capita across different countries and time periods.
  - Visualise temperature changes over time based on different sources of emissions.

**Data Sources**

[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

[CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset](https://github.com/owid/co2-data?tab=readme-ov-file)

The underlying data source(s)
  - Global Carbon Project (GCP)
  - Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)
  - Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)
  - International Energy Agency (IEA)

**Data Warehousing**

With the complexity of the data MongoDB was used to warehouse the data.

#### Conclusion: ####
This project provides valuable insights into global CO₂ emissions, enabling users to better understand the sources to climate change.

For example,
- we can see that countries like the USA and Russia have the highest total CO₂ emissions, while smaller countries like Luxembourg and Estonia have high per capita emissions followed by USA,canada and Russsia.
- We also identified that coal and oil are the largest contributors to CO₂ emissions.
- Among all Greenhouse gases, CO2 emission has the heighest temprature change which is 19.07°C.

By empowering users with interactive tools and accessible data, this project aims to inspire action, inform decisions, and contribute to the global fight against climate change. 

This project serves as a powerful tool for governments and private sectors alike,helping them make data-driven decisions to reduce CO₂ emissions.

  **For Governments:**
  **Policy Formulation and Climate Strategy:**
  -  **Identify Key Polluters:** By using this project’s visualizations, governments can pinpoint which sectors, regions, or industries contribute the most to CO₂ emissions, allowing for more targeted policies.
  -   **Track National Emissions:** Governments can monitor their country’s CO₂ emissions over time, evaluating the effectiveness of past policies and adjusting future climate strategies.
  
  **Sustainable Development Planning**
  -  **Energy Transition Plans:** By understanding which fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) contribute most to emissions, governments can prioritize transitioning to renewable energy sources.
  -  **Urban Planning and Transportation:** Data on CO₂ emissions can guide city planning and the development of green infrastructure,such as public transport, renewable energy grids, and low-carbon construction methods.
  
   **For Private Sectors:**
 - **Investing in Renewable Energy:** By seeing how fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas contribute to national emissions, companies can make informed decisions about transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to reduce their carbon footprint.
